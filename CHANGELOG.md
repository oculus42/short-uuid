## [4.0.0] - 2020-09-06 (Unreleased)
### MAJOR CHANGES
- üõë short-uuid will now throw an error when provided an alphabet with duplicate characters. Duplicate characters will cause translation errors.
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è 4.0.0 is written in modern ECMAScript. It uses features through ES9/ES2018.
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è 4.x does not yet include the pre-built version for browsers. If needed, continue to use 3.1.1 in the meantime.
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, short-uuid will pad shortened IDs to a consistent length.
  - Padding does not affect translation, and the values are compatible with previous releases.
  - Padding can be disabled with the option `consistentLength: false` when instantiating a translator. This is consistent with previous versions.
